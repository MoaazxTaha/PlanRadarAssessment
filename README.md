- The assessment is written in swift with combine.
- The Backend layer is written with Objective C with ReactiveObjC. 
- The UI is created with swiftUI and combine.
- The app built to work reactivelty over a REST api built with RxSwift
- The app works online by fetching data from the API to present it then save it to coredata.
- The app works ooffline by showing the saved models from coredata.
- MVVM is the architcutre pattern.
- The app performs in both a dark and light mode.
- The user can search for location to show the weather info.
